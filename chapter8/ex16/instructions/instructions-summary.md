Create a program called `Planets` with an enumeration that contains the names of the eight planets in our solar system. Prompt the user for a planet name and use the `ordinal()` method to display the planetâ€™s position.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter a planet in our solar system >> Saturn
You entered SATURN
SATURN is 6 planet(s) from the sun
```
