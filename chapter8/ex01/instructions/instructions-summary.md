Write an application called `NineInts` that stores nine integers in an array named `numbers`. Display the integers from first to last, and then display the integers from last to first. Do not hard code the integers.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
10  15  19  23  26  29  31  34  38  
38  34  31  29  26  23  19  15  10 
```

info> When testing your program use the integers listed in the example above.
