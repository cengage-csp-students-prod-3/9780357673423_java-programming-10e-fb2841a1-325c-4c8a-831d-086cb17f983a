## Scenario

You are a software developer and your client uses a program that averages the yearly rainfall. You noticed that the program uses 12 different variables to hold the 12 monthly values. You know that using arrays will be much more effective. You will initialize the monthly values (7.1,5.0,5.7,4.8,3.2,2.6,1.1,1.5,2.6,5.6,8.1,7.2) in a single dimension array and calculate the total, average, and the highest rainfall in Seattle, Washington.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will debug the logic and syntax errors to determine the total rainfall in a year as well as the average and highest rainfalls per month in Seattle, Washington. Data is from the National Weather Service and is declared and initialized in a single dimension array.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Seattle's total rainfall in a year is:  54.50000000000001 inches
Average rainfall per month in Seattle is:  4.541666666666667 inches
Highest rainfall in a month in Seattle was:  8.1 inches
```
