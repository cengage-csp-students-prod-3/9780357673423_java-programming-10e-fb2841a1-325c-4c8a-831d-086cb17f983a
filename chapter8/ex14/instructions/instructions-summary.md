Write an application called `TimesAndInstructors` that stores at least five different college courses (such as CIS101), the time it first meets in the week (such as Mon 9 am), and the instructor (such as Khan) in a two-dimensional array. Allow the user to enter a course name and display the corresponding time and instructor. If the course exists twice, display details for both sessions. If the course does not exist, display an error message and re-prompt the user for a course.

Use the five college courses listed below when testing your program.

Course | Time | Instructor
-------|------|-----------
CIS101 | Mon 9 am | Kahn
CIS210 | Mon 11 am | Patel
MKT100 | Tues 8:30 am | Wong
ACC150 | Tues 6 pm | Deitrich
CIS101 | Fri 1 pm | Lennon

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
