## Part A
Create a `record` named `Inventor` that stores two `String` values: 
* the name of an inventor
* the inventorâ€™s country of origin


## Part B
Create an `Invention` class with three fields:
* a `String` description of the invention
* an `Inventor` object
* a `LocalDate` object that holds the date of the `Invention`

Create a constructor that requires values for all three fields and a `toString()` method that constructs a `String` that displays all the data about the `Invention`. 


## Part C
Write an `InventionDemo` application that prompts the user for all the data needed to create an `Invention` and then uses the `toString()` method to display the data.
