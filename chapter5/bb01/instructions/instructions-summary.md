## Scenario
Let’s play the guessing game. In this game, the user will be asked to input any value from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and the Java application will display the guessed value.  If the value is not within the specified range, then an error message is displayed.

## Instructions
This exercise allows the user to input any value – even less than 1 and greater than 100.  Debug the logic and syntax errors so that the program validates the value entered by the user and correctly displays the value along with an appropriate message.

Some examples of the program are shown below: 
```
Please enter your guessed number from 1 - 100: 121
You entered  121. This number is invalid as it is not within the specified range (1-100)
```
```
Please enter your guessed number from 1 - 100: 40 
Your guessed number is: 40
This number is valid and within the specified range (1-100).
```
