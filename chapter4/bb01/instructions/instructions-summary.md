## Scenario

Let's explore using methods available in a built-in Java class. This application will practice using methods available in the `Math` class. Example of `pow` (power), `max` (maximum), `min` (minimum), `sqrt` (square root) and `round` methods of the `Math` class will be used for this exercise.

## Instructions

This exercise has syntax errors. Debug the errors so that the program displays the correct returned values of the `pow`, `max`, `min`, `sqrt` and `round` `Math` class methods.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a integer value:
14
Enter a integer value:
4
Enter a integer value:
11
Enter a double value:
9.8
The power of 14 and 4 is: 38416.0
The maximum value of 14 and 4 is: 14
The minimum value of 14 and 4 is: 4
The square root value of 11 is: 3.3166247903554
The rounded value of 9.8 is: 10.0
```
