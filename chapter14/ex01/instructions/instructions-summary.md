## Part A
Write an application called `JBookQuote` that displays a `JFrame` containing the opening sentence or two from your favorite book.

## Part B
Copy the contents of the *JBookQuote.java* file and paste them into the *JBookQuote2.java* file. Add a button to the frame in the `JBookQuote` program. When the user clicks the button, display the title of the book that contains the quote. Rename the class `JBookQuote2`.

An example of the program is shown below: 

![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Book Quote Java program. The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Book Quote" in the title bar. Within the window, a label displays the following opening sentence from the book, "A Christmas Carol." To begin with, Marley was dead. A button is displayed below this sentence which says, "Click for source." Clicking this button, displays the title of the book in which the sentence appears. The title, "A Christmas Carol" is displayed below the button with two asterisks on either sides of the title.](../assets/xrDWrkCmRPuM26SvCxBI.png)
