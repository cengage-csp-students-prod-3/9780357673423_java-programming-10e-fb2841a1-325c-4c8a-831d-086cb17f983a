## Part A
Search the Internet for information about how to use a `JTextArea`, its constructors, and its `setText()` and `append()` methods. Write an application called `JDorm` that allows the user to select at least four options for a dormitory room. Use `JCheckBoxes` for options such as private room, Internet connection, cable TV connection, microwave, refrigerator, and so on. When the application starts, use a text area to display a message listing the options that are not yet selected. As the user selects and deselects options, add appropriate messages to the text area so it accumulates a running list that reflects the user’s choices.

## Part B
Copy the contents of the *JDorm.java* file into the *JDorm2.java file* and modify the application so that instead of a running list of the user’s choices, the application displays only the current choices. Rename the class `JDorm2`.

info> The selected choices listed in the `JTextArea` must match the text assigned to the `JCheckBox`. 

An example of the program is shown below:

![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Dorm Java program that allows a user to select the facilities required in a dormitory room. The options are listed using J Checkboxes. The selected options are displayed in a J TextArea. The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Dorm Room Options" in the title bar. J Checkboxes are used to display the options for facilities available in the dormitory. The options displayed are the following. Private. Internet. Cable T V. Microwave. Refrigerator. In the screenshot, the following options are selected. Private. Internet. Microwave. Refrigerator. In the J TextArea, the options that have not been selected are displayed with a No. The following options are displayed in the J TextArea as a list from top to bottom based on the selection. Private. No Cable T V. Internet. Microwave. Refrigerator.](../assets/fSBIkK48Qp619WbGeFdA.png)
