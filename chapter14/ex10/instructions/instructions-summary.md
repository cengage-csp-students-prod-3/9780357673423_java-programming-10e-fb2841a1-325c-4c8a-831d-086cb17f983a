Create an application called `JPhotoFrame` for Paula’s Portraits, a photography studio. The application allows users to compute the price of a photography session. Paula’s base price is **$40** for an in-studio photo session with one person. The in-studio fee is **$75** for a session with two or more subjects, and **$95** for a session with a pet. A **$90** fee is added to take photos on location instead of in the studio. Include a set of mutually exclusive check boxes to select the portrait subject and another set for the session location. Include the following labels as appropriate to explain the application’s functionality: 

* One human subject
* Two or more human subjects
* Pet subject
* On location
* In studio

Display the final price in a `JTextField` component. 

An example of the program is shown below:

![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Photo Frame Java program that allows a user to compute the price for a photography session at Paula’s Portraits, a photography studio. The options are listed using J Checkboxes and the price computed is displayed in a text field.  The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Portrait options selection" in the title bar. A J Label is used to display the text, "Select options." Two J Checkboxes are used to display mutually exclusive options for one human subject and two or more human subjects. Additionally, a J Checkbox is displayed for a Pet subject. Mutually exclusive options are displayed for on location or in studio photoshoot again using J Checkboxes. A J Label is used to display the following text above the text field that displays the total price. "Paula's Portraits Portrait fee." In the screenshot shown, the following options have been selected. One human subject. On location. The total price is displayed as 130 in the text field.](../assets/2kfxcxmgQK6MJw6w3bZv.png)
