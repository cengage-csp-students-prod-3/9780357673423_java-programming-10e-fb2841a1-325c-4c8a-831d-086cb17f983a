## Part A
Write an application called `JFrameDisableButton` that instantiates a `JFrame` that contains a `JButton`. Disable the `JButton` after the user clicks it.

## Part B
Copy the contents of the *JFrameDisableButton.java* file into the *JFrameDisableButton2.java* file and modify the `JFrameDisableButton` program so that the `JButton` is not disabled until the user has clicked at least **eight** times. At that point, display a `JLabel` that indicates **Thatâ€™s enough!**. Rename the class as `JFrameDisableButton2`.

An example of the program is shown below:
![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Frame Disable Button Java program. The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Frame" in the title bar. Within the window, a button that says "Press Me" is displayed. The button does not get disabled until it is clicked 8 times. After it has been clicked 8 times, the button gets disabled and a label that says "That's enough!" is displayed below the button.](../assets/feaQNSvRUZfn4tYFf6JQ.png)
