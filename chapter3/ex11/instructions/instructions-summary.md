Create a class named `BookBilling` that includes three overloaded `computeBill()` methods for the Happy Memories Company, which sells photo books.

* When `computeBill()` receives no parameters, the method computes the price of one photo book at **$14.99**, adds **8** percent tax, and returns the total due.
* When `computeBill()` receives one parameter, it represents the quantity ordered. Multiply the value by **$14.99**, add **8** percent tax, and return the total due.
* When `computeBill()` receives two parameters, they represent the quantity ordered and a coupon value. Multiply the quantity by **$14.99**, reduce the result by the coupon value, add **8** percent tax, and then return the total due.

Write a `main()` method that prompts the user for the number of books ordered and stores it as an int, prompts for a coupon value and stores it as a double, and tests all three overloaded methods.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter quantity ordered >> 2
Enter coupon value >> 5.00
One book is $16.1892
2 books with no coupon are $32.3784
2 books with a coupon worth $5.0 are $26.9784
```
