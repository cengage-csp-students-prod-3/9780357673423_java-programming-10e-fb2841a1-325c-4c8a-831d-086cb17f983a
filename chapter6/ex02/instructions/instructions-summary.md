Write an application called `EvenEntryLoop` that asks a user to type an even number or the sentinel value **999** to stop. When the user types an even number, display the message **Good job!** and then ask for another input. When the user types an odd number, display an error message and then ask for another input. When the user types the sentinel value **999**, end the program.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter an even number or 999 to quit >> 12
Good job!
Enter an even number or 999 to quit >> 20
Good job!
Enter an even number or 999 to quit >> 23
23 is not an even number
Enter an even number or 999 to quit >> 999
```
