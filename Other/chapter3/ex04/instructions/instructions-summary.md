Create a class named `Percentages` whose `main()` method holds two `double` variables, and prompt the user for values. Pass both variables to a method named `computePercent()` that displays the two values and the value of the first number as a percentage of the second one. For example, if the numbers are **2.0** and **5.0**, the method should display a statement similar to: 2.0 is 40 percent of 5.0. Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a double >> 3.7
Enter another double >> 12.3
3.7 is 30.081300813008127 percent of 12.3
12.3 is 332.43243243243245 percent of 3.7
```
