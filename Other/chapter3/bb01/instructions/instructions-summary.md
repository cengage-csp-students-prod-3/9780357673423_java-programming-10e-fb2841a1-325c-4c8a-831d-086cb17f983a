## Scenario

Let's practice our multiplication. In this Java application a method will be passed with two integer values and it will return the product of these values.

## Instructions

This exercise has syntax errors. Debug the errors so that the program displays the product of two integer numbers entered by the user from a keyboard. Be sure that you do not hard code the returned product.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter an integer value for first number
3
Enter an integer value for second number
8
The product of 3 and 8  is : 24
```
