There are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard. Create a class named `InchConversion`. Its `main()` method accepts a value in inches from a user at the keyboard and then passes the entered value to two methods, `convertToFeet` and `convertToYards`. One converts the value from inches to feet, and the other converts the same value from inches to yards. Each method displays the results with appropriate explanation.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter inches >> 2395
2395 inches is 199.58333333333334 feet
2395 inches is 66.52777777777777 yards
```
