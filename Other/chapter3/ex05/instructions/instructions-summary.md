To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is **10** times the student’s grade point average. In other words, a student with a **3.2** grade point average receives a **$32.0** credit. Create a class called `BookstoreCredit` that prompts a student for a name and grade point average and then passes the values to a method called `computeDiscount()` that displays a descriptive message. The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter your name >> Jane Doe
Enter your gpa >> 3.6
Jane Doe, your GPA is 3.6, so your credit is $36.0
```
