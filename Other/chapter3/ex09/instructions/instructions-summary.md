The Renew Your Home Company estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. Create a class called `JobPricing` that contains a `main()` method that prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Patel bathroom remodel), the cost of materials as a `double`, the number of hours of work required as a `double`, and the number of hours of travel time as a `double`. Pass the numeric data to a method called `computePrice()` that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the `main()` method, where the job name and estimated price are displayed.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter job description >> Apartment 23A renovation
Enter cost of materials >> 2300
Enter hours on the job work >> 35.5
Enter hours traveling >> 2
The price for Apartment 23A renovation is $3566.5
```
