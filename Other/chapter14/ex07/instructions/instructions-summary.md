Write an application called `JCapitals` that allows a user to select a country from a list box that contains at least seven options. After the user makes a selection, display the countryâ€™s capital city in a `JTextField` component. 

An example of the program is shown below:

The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Capitals" in the title bar. A label that says "Select a country" is displayed next to a list box.
