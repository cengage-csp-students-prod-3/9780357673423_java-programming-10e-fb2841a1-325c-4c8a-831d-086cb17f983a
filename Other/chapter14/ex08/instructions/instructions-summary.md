Write an application called `JInsurance` that allows the user to choose insurance options in `JCheckBox` objects. Use a `ButtonGroup` to allow the user to select only one of two insurance typesâ€”**HMO** (health maintenance organization) or **PPO** (preferred provider organization). Use regular (single) `JCheckBox` objects for dental insurance and vision insurance options; the user can select one option, both options, or neither option.

As the user selects each option, display its name and price in a `JTextField`; the HMO costs **$200** per month, the PPO costs **$600** per month, the dental coverage adds **$75** per month, and the vision care adds **$20** per month. When a user deselects the vision or dental options, make the text field blank. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Insurance Java program that allows a user to select insurance options. The cost of insurance is displayed after the options have been selected. The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Check Box" in the title bar. J Checkboxes are used to display the options. The H M O or health maintenance organization and P P O or preferred provider organization options are displayed in two J Checkboxes that are displayed in a button group. Only one of the options can be selected. Additionally dental and vision insurance options are displayed using single J Checkboxes that are not part of a button group. Either one, both, or none of them can be selected. Once the options are selected, the cost information is displayed in a text field below the checkboxes. In the screenshot displayed, the P P O and Dental options have been selected. The text displayed in the text field indicates that dental insurance costs 75 dollars more.](../assets/7b2ljJ6ISnKhsS5XnuWu.png)
