Write an application called `FindSelectedFiles` that determines which, if any, of the following files are stored in the current working directory: *autoexec.bat*, *FileStatistics.class*, *example.docx*, *example2.txt*. If the file exists, display its filepath and an indicator that it exists.

info> The default file path for your project directory is `/home/nt-user/workspace/`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
/home/nt-user/workspace/example.docx exists
/home/nt-user/workspace/example2.txt exists
2 of the files exist
```
