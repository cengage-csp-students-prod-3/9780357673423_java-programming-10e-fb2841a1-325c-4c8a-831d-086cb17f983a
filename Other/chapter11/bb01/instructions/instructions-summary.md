## Scenario

You are a software developer and your client uses a data file that stores the customer ID and discount percentages for each customer. This is a text file and values are separated by comma.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will read the data file – _CusDiscount.txt_ – using try and catch blocks to handle any file input/output errors. Your program will output the data in a readable manner and, finally, display the number of records in a file.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Customer ID AB1001 gets 0% discount
Customer ID HT1031 gets 10% discount
Customer ID ZB1476 gets 5% discount
Customer ID AZ1202 gets 0% discount
Customer ID CD1456 gets 3% discount
Customer ID EF3245 gets 0% discount
Customer ID VX4890 gets 4% discount
There are 7 records in this file.
```
