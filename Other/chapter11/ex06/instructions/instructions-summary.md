## Part A
Write an application called `SeekPosition` that allows a user to enter a filename and an integer representing a file position. Assume that the file is in the same folder as your executing program. Access the requested position within the file, and display the next 10 characters there.

info> The default file path for your project directory is `./`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a file name >> example.txt
Enter a position number >> 102
y be found
```

## Part B
Copy the contents of the *SeekPosition.java* file into the *SeekPosition2.java* file and modify the `SeekPosition` class so that instead of displaying 10 characters, the user enters the number of characters to display, beginning with the requested position. Rename the class `SeekPosition2`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a file name >> example.txt
Enter a position number >> 232
Enter number of characters to display >> 43
