## Part A
Serendipity Gifts accepts user orders for its products interactively. Users might make the following errors as they enter data:

* The item number ordered is not numeric, too low (less than 0), or too high (more than 9999).
* The quantity is not numeric, too low (less than 1), or too high (more than 12).
* The item number is not a currently valid item.

Although the company might expand in the future, its current inventory consists of the items listed in the table below: 

Item Number | Price ($)
------------|----------
111 | 0.89
222 | 1.47
333 | 2.43
444 | 5.99

Create a class called `OrderMessages` that stores an array of usable error messages. 

## Part B
Create an `OrderException` class that accepts one of the messages as its parameter.

## Part C
Create an application called `PlaceAnOrder` that contains prompts for an item number and quantity. Allow for the possibility of nonnumeric entries as well as out-of-range entries and entries that do not match any of the currently available item numbers. The program should display an appropriate message stored in the `OrderMessages` class if an error has occurred. If no errors exist in the entered data, compute the userâ€™s total amount due (quantity times price each) and display it.

Examples of the program are shown below:
```
Enter item number 111
Enter quantity 2
Order OK. Total is $1.78
  (2 at $0.89 each)
```
```
Enter item number 123 
Enter quantity 1
Message is: Item number does not exist 
```
