## Scenario
Let’s play the guessing game. In this game, the user will be asked to input any value from 1 to 100 (inclusive). To validate the user’s input value a while loop is used. If the value is invalid, the loop will ask the user to input the value again, until the user enters a correct value.

## Instructions
This exercise will allow the user to input any values – even less than 1 and greater than 100.  You will have to debug the logic and syntax errors so that the program will only allow the user to enter the values from 1 to 100.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Please enter your guess number from 1 - 100: 33
Your guess number is: 33
```
