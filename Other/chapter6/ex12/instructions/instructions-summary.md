## Part A
The Huntington High School basketball team has five players named Ali, Bob, Cai, Dan, and Eli. Write a program called `BarChart` that accepts the number of points scored by each player in a game, and create a bar chart that illustrates the points scored by displaying an asterisk for each point. The output looks similar to the example shown below. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter points earned by Ali >> 12 
Enter points earned by Bob >> 11
Enter points earned by Cai >> 12
Enter points earned by Dan >> 15
Enter points earned by Eli >> 12

Points for Game

Ali  ************
Bob  ***********
Cai  ************
Dan  ***************
Eli  ************
```

## Part B

Copy your code from the *BarChart.java* file into the *BarChart2.java* file. Rename the class to `BarChart2` and modify the program to accept the number of points scored by each player in a season. The bar chart displays one asterisk for each 10 points scored by a player. For example, if a player has scored 48 points, then display four asterisks.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter points earned for the season
    by Ali >> 82
    by Bob >> 104
    by Cai >> 88
    by Dan >> 90
    by Eli >> 73

Points for Season 
(each asterisk represents 10 points)

Ali  ********
Bob  **********
Cai  ********
Dan  *********
Eli  *******
```
