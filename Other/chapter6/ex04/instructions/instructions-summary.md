Write an application called `Inbetween` that prompts a user for two integers and displays every integer between them. Display a message if there are no integers between the entered values. Make sure the program works regardless of which entered value is larger. 

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter an integer >> 2
Enter another integer >> 23
The numbers between 2 and 23 include: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
```
