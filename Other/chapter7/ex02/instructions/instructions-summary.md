Write an application called `BabyNameComparison` that prompts the user for three first names and concatenates them in every possible two-name combination so that new parents can easily compare them to find the most pleasing baby name.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter a name >> John
Enter a second name >> Beth
Enter a third name >> Taylor
The combinations are:
John Beth
John Taylor
Beth John
Beth Taylor
Taylor John
Taylor Beth
```
