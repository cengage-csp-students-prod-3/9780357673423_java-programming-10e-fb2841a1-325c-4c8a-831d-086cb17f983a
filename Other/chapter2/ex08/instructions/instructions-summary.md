## Part A
The Huntington Boys and Girls Club is conducting a fundraiser by selling chili dinners to go. The price is **$7** for an adult’s meal and **$4** for a child’s meal. Write a program called `ChiliToGo` that accepts the number of each type of meal ordered, and display the total money collected for adults’ meals, children’s meals, and all meals.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter number of adult meals ordered >> 6
Enter number of child meals ordered >> 25
6 adult meals were ordered at $7.0 each.
      Total is $42.0
25 child meals were ordered at $4.0 each.
      Total is $100.0
Grand total for all meals is $142.0
```

## Part B
In the `ChiliToGo` program, the costs to produce an adult’s meal and a child’s meal are **$4.35** and **$3.10**, respectively. Copy the code from the *ChiliToGo.java* file into the *ChiliToGoProfit.java* file and modify the program to display the total profit for each type of meal as well as the grand total profit.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter number of adult meals ordered >> 6
Enter number of child meals ordered >> 25
6 adult meals were ordered at $7.0 each.
      Total is $42.0
25 child meals were ordered at $4.0 each.
      Total is $100.0
Grand total for all meals is $142.0
Profits:
      Adult profit is $15.900000000000002
      Child profit is $22.5
Total profit is $38.400000000000006
