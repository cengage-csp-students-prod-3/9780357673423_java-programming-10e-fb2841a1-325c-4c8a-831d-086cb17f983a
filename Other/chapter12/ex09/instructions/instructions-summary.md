Loris Manufacturing makes 1,000 products per month and has been increasing production at a rate of 6 percent each month. Write a program called `ProductionGoal` that accepts a production goal from the user. If the entered goal is less than 1,000, display a message that indicates the goal has already been met. Otherwise, call a recursive method called `productionStats()` that accepts the current month, the current production value, the rate of growth, and the goal. Then, display the number of months from the current one in which the goal will be met.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter the production goal >> 3200
Goal will be met in month 20
   when production is 3207.1354722128435
```
