Write a program called `QuartsToGallonsWithExceptionHandling` that accepts a number of quarts from a user and converts the value to gallons. Include exception-handling capabilities in the program so that while any nonnumeric value is entered, the program continually displays an error message, re-prompts the user, and accepts new input. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter quarts needed >> Rusty
Invalid data entry     
Enter quarts needed >> 5
A job that needs 5 quarts requires 1 gallons plus 1 quarts.
```
