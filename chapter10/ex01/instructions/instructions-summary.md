Write an application named `BadSubscriptCaught` in which you declare an array of eight first names. Write a `try` block in which you prompt the user for an integer and display the name in the requested position. Create a `catch` block that catches the potential `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` thrown when the user enters a number that is out of range. The catch block also should display an error message.

Examples of the program are shown below: 

```
Enter a number, and I will display a name >> 
5
Name is Fred
```
```
Enter a number, and I will display a name >> 
10
Subscript out of range.
```
