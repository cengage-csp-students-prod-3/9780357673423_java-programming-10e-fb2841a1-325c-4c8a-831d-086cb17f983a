Create a file using any word-processing program or text editor. Write an application called `FileStatistics` that prompts the user for the filename and displays the fileâ€™s path, name, folder, size, and time of last modification.

> The default file path for your project directory is `./`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter file name >> example.txt
Path is ./example.txt
File name is example.txt
Folder name is workspace
File's size is 447
File's creation time is 2021-10-18T17:26:21.224324Z
```
