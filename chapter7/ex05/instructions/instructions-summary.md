Write an application called `CountWords` that counts the words in a `String` entered by a user. Words are separated by any combination of spaces, periods, commas, semicolons, question marks, exclamation points, or dashes. 

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a string >> "The future ain't what it used to be" - Yogi Berra
There are 10 words in the string
```
