## Part A
Create a program called `CountSpaces` that contains a `String` that holds your favorite inspirational quote and display the total number of spaces contained in the `String`.


## Part B
Copy the code from the *CountSpaces.java* into the *CountSpaces2.java* file and modify the application so that it counts the total number of spaces contained in a quote entered by the user. Rename the class `CountSpaces2`. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter an inspirational quote >> Life is like a box of chocolates.
The number of spaces is 6
```
