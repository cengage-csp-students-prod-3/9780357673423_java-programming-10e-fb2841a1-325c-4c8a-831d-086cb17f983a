## Scenario
You are a music lover and always wanted to make a playlist of artists that you like. Now after learning about the `ArrayList` class, you are excited to create an initial list of five artists that you would like to be in your playlist.

In this exercise, you will create a playlist of music artists using the `ArrayList` class. You will use the `ArrayList` class methods such as add, set, and remove to get your top five artists in your playlist.

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will use Java’s `Collection` interface, `ArrayList`, and take advantage that it is dynamically re-sizeable.  You will use the `ArrayList` `add`, `set`, and `remove` methods to set up your `PlayList`. Debug the exercise as it contains syntax and logic errors.

An example of the program is shown below:
