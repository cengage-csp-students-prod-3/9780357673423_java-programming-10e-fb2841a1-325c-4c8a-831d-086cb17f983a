Create an application called `ArrayMethodDemo` that prompts a user for 10 integers and stores them in an array. 

The application should call the five methods listed below:

info> Each of the five methods should be `void`, they should not return any values. 

* (1) `display(int[])` - display all the integers


* (2) `displayReverse(int[])` - display all the integers in reverse order


* (3) `displaySum(int[])` - display the sum of the integers 


* (4) `displayLessThan(int[], int)` - display all values less than 12 or a message if none are less than 12


* (5) `displayHigherThanAverage(int[])` - display all values that are higher than the calculated average value


An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter integer #1 >> 3
Enter integer #2 >> 34
Enter integer #3 >> 47
Enter integer #4 >> 3
Enter integer #5 >> 44
Enter integer #6 >> 27
Enter integer #7 >> 32
Enter integer #8 >> 34
Enter integer #9 >> 26
Enter integer #10 >> 29
The numbers are  3  34  47  3  44  27  32  34  26  29  
The numbers in reverse order are  29  26  34  32  27  44  3  47  34  3 
The sum of all numbers is 279
3 3 are less than the limit 12
The average is 27.9
34  47  44  32  34  29  are greater than the average
```
