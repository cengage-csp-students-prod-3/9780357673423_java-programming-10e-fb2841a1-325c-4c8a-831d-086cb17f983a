Write a program called `DistanceFromAverage` which allows a user to enter up to 15 `double` values. The user should enter **99999** to quit entering numbers. Display an error message if the user quits without entering any numbers; otherwise, display a count of the numbers entered, the arithmetic average of the numbers, and each entered value and its distance from the average.

An example of the program is show below: 
```
Enter a numeric value or 99999 to quit >> 12.2
Enter next numeric value or 99999 to quit >> 11
Enter next numeric value or 99999 to quit >> 18.2
Enter next numeric value or 99999 to quit >> .5
Enter next numeric value or 99999 to quit >> 99999
You entered 4 numbers and their average is 10.475
12.2 is 1.7249999999999996 away from the average
11.0 is 0.5250000000000004 away from the average
18.2 is 7.725 away from the average
0.5 is -9.975 away from the average
```
