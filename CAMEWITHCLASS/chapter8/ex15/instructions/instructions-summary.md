Create an application called `DayOfWeek` that contains an enumeration that represents the days of the week. Display a list of the days, and then prompt the user for a day. Display business hours for the chosen day. Assume that the business is open from 11 to 5 on Sunday, 9 to 9 on weekdays, and 10 to 6 on Saturday.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
The days are:
SUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT 
Enter the day code to find our hours >> TUE
You entered TUE
On TUE our hours are 9 - 9
```
