Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges **$3.25** for a dozen eggs or **45** cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program called `Eggs` that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85. 
```
