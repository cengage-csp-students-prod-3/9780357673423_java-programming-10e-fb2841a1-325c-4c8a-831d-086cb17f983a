## Part B

Convert the `QuartsToGallons` program to an interactive application called `QuartsToGallonsInteractive` by copying the file contents from one to the other. Instead of assigning a value to the number of quarts, accept the value from the user as input.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter quarts needed >> 157
A job that needs 157 quarts requires 39 gallons plus 1 quarts.
```
