Create a file that contains a line of your favorite song lyric. Use a text editor such as Notepad, and save the file. Copy the file contents, and paste them into a word-processing program such as Word. Write an application called `FileSizeComparison` that prompts the user for the names of the files and displays the sizes of the two files as well as the ratio of their sizes to each other.

> You will not be able to open the `.docx` files in MindTap.

> The default file path for your project directory is `./`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter name of text file >> lyric.txt
Enter name of Word file >> lyric.docx
lyric.txt is 37 bytes long
lyric.docx is 11856 bytes long
The text file is 0.31207827260458837% of the size of the Word file
```
