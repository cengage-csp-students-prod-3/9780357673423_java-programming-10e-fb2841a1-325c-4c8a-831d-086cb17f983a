Create a class named `NumbersDemo` whose `main()` method holds two integer variables. Prompt the user for values for the variables. In turn, pass each value to methods named `displayTwiceTheNumber()`, `displayNumberPlusFive()`, and `displayNumberSquared()`. Create each method to perform the task its name implies.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter an integer >> 5
Enter another integer >> 93
5 times 2 is 10
5 plus 5 is 10
5 squared is 25
93 times 2 is 186
93 plus 5 is 98
93 squared is 8649
```
