The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer turns in the current calendar year. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20. For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15 and then multiplying by 20. 

Create a class called `Insurance` that prompts a user for the current year and a birth year. Pass both to a method called `calculatePremium()` that calculates and returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter the current year >> 2021
Enter the birth year >> 1980
The premium is $380
```
