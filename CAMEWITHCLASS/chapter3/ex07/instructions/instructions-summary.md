Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create a class called `PaintCalculator` with a `main()` method that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular room, all three of type `double`. Pass these three values to a method called `computeArea()` that does the following:

* Calculates the wall area for a room
* Passes the calculated wall area to another method called `computeGallons()` that calculates and returns the number of gallons of paint needed
* Displays the number of gallons needed
* Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a whole gallon
* Returns the price to the `main()` method

The `main()` method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64.

An example of the program is shown below; 
```
Enter the room's length >> 13.2
Enter the room's width >> 10.5
Enter the room's height >> 9.0
You will need 1.2188571428571429 gallons
The price to paint the room is $39.00342857142857
```

info> In order to complete the `computeArea()` method, you first need to implement the `computeGallons()` method.
