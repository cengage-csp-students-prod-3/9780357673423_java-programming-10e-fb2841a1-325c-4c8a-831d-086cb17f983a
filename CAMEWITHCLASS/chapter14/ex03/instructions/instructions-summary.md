Create an application called `JFacts` with a `JFrame` and at least six labels that contain facts about your favorite topicâ€”for example, the French Revolution or astronomy. Every time the user clicks a `JButton`, remove one of the labels and add a different one.

An example of the program is shown below: 

![A screenshot of the GUI application displayed by the J Facts Java program. The application displays a window frame using the J Frame class with the title, "Facts" in the title bar. Within the window, a J Label is used to display one of six random facts. Above the fact, a button that says, "Press to change fact" is displayed. Clicking on this button displays a new random fact. In the screenshot, the following fact is displayed below a line of asterisks. Tale of Two Cities is a novel set during the French Revolution.](../assets/AyHsDOPpT3OVA0h6Ni0F.png)
