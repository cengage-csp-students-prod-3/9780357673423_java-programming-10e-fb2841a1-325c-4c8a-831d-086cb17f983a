The Freemont Automobile Factory has set a goal that each worker will eventually produce 10,000 parts per month within two years. The company has discovered that the longer a worker has been on the job, the more parts the worker can produce.

Write an application called `IncreasedProduction` that prompts for the number of parts a worker currently produces. Then compute and display a worker’s anticipated output each month for 24 months, assuming the worker’s production increases by **6** percent each month. Also display a message that shows the month number in which production exceeds **10,000** parts (**The month in which production exceeds 10000.0 is month #**) or a message indicating that the worker will not reach the goal within 24 months (**This worker will not reach 10000.0 in 24 months**).

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
