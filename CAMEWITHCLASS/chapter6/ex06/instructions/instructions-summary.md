Write an application called `DiagonalNums` that prompts the user for a single-digit integer and uses a loop to create the pattern shown in the example below. In the example, the user entered a **3**, and 10 lines are displayed; each 3 appears one additional space to the right.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a single digit >> 3
3
 3
  3
   3
    3
     3
      3
       3
        3
         3
```
