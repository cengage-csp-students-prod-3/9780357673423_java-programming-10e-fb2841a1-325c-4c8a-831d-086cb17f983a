Write an application called `QuizScoreStatistics` that allows a user to enter any number of student quiz scores until the user enters a sentinel value of **99**. If the score entered is less than **0** or greater than **10**, display an appropriate message and do not use the score. After all the scores have been entered, display the number of scores entered, the highest score, the lowest score, and the arithmetic average.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a score >> 8
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 10
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 6
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 5
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 5
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 5
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 9
Enter another score or 99 to quit >> 99
7 valid scores were entered
Highest was 10
Lowest was 5
Average was 6.857142857142857
```
