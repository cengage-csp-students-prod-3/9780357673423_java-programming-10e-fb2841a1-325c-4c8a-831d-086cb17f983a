Write an application called `Perfect` that displays every perfect number from 1 through a user-supplied limit. A perfect number is one that equals the sum of all the numbers that divide evenly into it. For example, 6 is perfect because 1, 2, and 3 divide evenly into it, and their sum is 6; however, 12 is not a perfect number because 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 divide evenly into it, but their sum is greater than 12. 

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a maximum number >> 496
The number 6 is perfect
The number 28 is perfect
The number 496 is perfect
```
