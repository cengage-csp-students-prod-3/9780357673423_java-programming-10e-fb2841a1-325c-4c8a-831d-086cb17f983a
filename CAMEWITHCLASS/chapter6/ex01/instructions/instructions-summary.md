## Part A
Write an application called `CountByFives` that includes final constants named `START` and `STOP` that are set to **5** and **500**, respectively. The application counts by five from 5 through 500 inclusive, and it starts a new line after every multiple of 50 (50, 100, 150, and so on).


## Part B
Copy contents of the `CountByFives` application into the *CountByAnything.java* file and modify it so that the user enters the value to count by. Start each new line after 10 values have been displayed. Rename the class to `CountByAnything`. 

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter number to count by >> 7
7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70  
77  84  91  98  105  112  119  126  133  140  
147  154  161  168  175  182  189  196  203  210  
217  224  231  238  245  252  259  266  273  280  
287  294  301  308  315  322  329  336  343  350  
357  364  371  378  385  392  399  406  413  420  
427  434  441  448  455  462  469  476  483  490  
497
```
