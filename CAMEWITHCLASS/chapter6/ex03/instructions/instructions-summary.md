Write an application called `Factorials` that displays the factorial for every integer value from 1 to a user-entered limit. A factorial of a number is the product of that number multiplied by each positive integer lower than it. For example, 4 factorial is 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1, or 24. 

info> You can use the int data type for the factorial, but if you enter a number greater than 16, the results will be unexpected because the factorial value exceeds the largest value that can be stored in an int.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a number to compute factorial >> 5
The factorial of 1 is 1
The factorial of 2 is 2
The factorial of 3 is 6
The factorial of 4 is 24
The factorial of 5 is 120
```
