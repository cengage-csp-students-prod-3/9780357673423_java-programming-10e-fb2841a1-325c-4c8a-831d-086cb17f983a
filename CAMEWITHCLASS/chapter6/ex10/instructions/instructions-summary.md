## Part A

Write an application called `RetirementGoal` that prompts a user for the number of years the user has until retirement and the amount of money the user can save annually. If the user enters **0** or a **negative number** for either value, re-prompt the user until valid entries are made. Assume that no interest is earned on the money. Display the amount of money the user will have at retirement.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
How many years until retirement? >> 25
How much can you save annually? >> 12238
If you save $12238 for 25 years, you will have $305950
```
