## Scenario

You are a software developer and your client uses a program where an order code is used as input, for example “TXHOU” - where the first two characters identifies the State and the next three characters identifies the closest airport. You will use `String` methods to break the strings into the two categories and add a dash between the state and airport code.

## Instructions

Debug the logic and syntax errors so that the program splits the `orderId` string into the `state` and `airport` codes and displays the codes with a hyphen between them. The program will be using the length and substring methods.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter an order code:
TXHOU
Order is from TX state
Order is closest to HOU airport code
Two substrings are now joined with a dash between two categories TX-HOU
```
