Write a program called `PhoneNumberFormat` that inserts parentheses, a space, and a dash into a `String` of 10 user-entered numbers to format it as a phone number. For example, **5153458912** becomes **(515) 345-8912**. If the user does not enter exactly **10** digits, display the error message: **The number is invalid**. Continue to accept user input until the user enters **999**. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter an area code and phone number
   as a series of 10 digits
   Enter 999 to quit >> 5153458912
The number is (515) 345-8912

Enter an area code and phone number
   as a series of 10 digits
   and I will display it in a nice format
     Enter 999 to quit >> 999
```
