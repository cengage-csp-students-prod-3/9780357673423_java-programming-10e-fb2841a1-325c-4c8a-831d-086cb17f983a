Three-letter acronyms are common in the business world. For example, in Java you use the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in the JDK (Java Development Kit) to write programs used by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that you might send over a LAN (local area network). Programmers even use the acronym TLA to stand for three-letter acronym. 

Write a program called `ThreeLetterAcronym` that allows a user to enter three words, and display the appropriate three-letter acronym in all uppercase letters. If the user enters more than three words, ignore the extra words. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Please enter three words >> Central Intelligence Agency
Original phrase was Central Intelligence Agency
Three letter acronym is CIA
```
