## Scenario

In a college, the same course can be offered with different sections. For example, COSC 1436 Programming I is a Master Course, but there is a section for C++ and another one for Java. The DebugMasterCourse file contains a superclass and the DebugSection file contains a subclass that will inherit MasterCourse methods.

## Instructions

In this activity, you will debug the logic and syntax errors to determine the correct extension of superclass and subclass inheritance.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
COSC 1436--Programming I is offered this semester as
C++ Section
```
