## Part A
Create a class named `Horse` that contains data fields for the name (`name`), color (`color`), and birth year (`birthYear`). Include get and set methods for these fields.


## Part B
Create a subclass of `Horse` named `RaceHorse`, which contains an additional field that holds the number of races (`races`) in which the `Horse` has competed and additional methods to get and set the new field. 

## Part C
Write an application called `DemoHorses` that prompts the user for appropriate field values and demonstrates using objects of each class, `Horse` and `RaceHorse`. 

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter name for horse >> Dexter
Enter color for Dexter >> Roan
Enter year of birth >> 2000
Enter name for race horse >> Zenyatta
Enter color for Zenyatta >> Dark Bay
Enter year of birth >> 2004
Enter number of races for Zenyatta >> 20
Dexter is Roan and was born in 2000.
Zenyatta is Dark Bay and was born in 2004.
Zenyatta has been in 20 races.
```
