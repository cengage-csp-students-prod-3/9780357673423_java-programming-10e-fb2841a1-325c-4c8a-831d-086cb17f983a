## Part A
Create an interface named `Turner`, with a single method named `turn()`. 

## Part B
Create a class named `Leaf` that implements `turn()` to display **Changing colors**. 

Create a class named `Page` that implements `turn()` to display **Going to the next page**. 

Create a class named `Pancake` that implements `turn()` to display **Flipping**.

## Part C
Write an application named `DemoTurners` that prompts the user to enter a type of turner (**L**, **P**, **C**) and demonstrates the `turn()` method for the class.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Do you want to create a (L)eaf, a (P)age
or a pan(C)ake >> C
Flipping.
```

## Part D
Think of two more objects that use `turn()`, create files and classes for them. Then, create the `DemoTurners2` class and add the new objects to the application.
