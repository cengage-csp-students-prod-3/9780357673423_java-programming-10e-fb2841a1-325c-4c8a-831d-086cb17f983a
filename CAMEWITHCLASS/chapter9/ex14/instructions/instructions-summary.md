## Part A
Create an interface called `Runner`. The interface has an abstract method called `run()`.

## Part B
Create classes called `Machine`, `Athlete`, and `PoliticalCandidate` that all implement `Runner`. The `run()` method displays a message describing the meaning of run to each class.

## Part C
Create an application called `DemoRunners` that prompts the user for the type of object to create. Create it, and display the message that describes run for the class.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Do you want to create an (A)thlete,
(M)achine, or (P)olitical candidate? >> M
When a machine is running, it is operating.
```
