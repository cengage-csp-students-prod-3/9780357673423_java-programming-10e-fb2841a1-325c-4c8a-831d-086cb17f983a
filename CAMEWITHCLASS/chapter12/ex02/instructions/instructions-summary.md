Write a program called `MultiplicationByAdding` that prompts the user for two integers. Pass them to a recursive method called `multiplication` that returns the product of the two integers without using multiplication. In other words, instead of using the multiplication operator, write the method using the knowledge that multiplication can be represented as a series of addition operations. For example, 4 multiplied by 6 is equivalent to 6 + 6 + 6 + 6.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter an integer >> 2
Enter another integer >> 13
2 * 13 = 26
```
