The examples below show the output of a program that displays any number of Os running diagonally from top left to bottom right. Now, write a program called `OppositeDiagonal` that prompts the user for a number of lines to display, and then use a recursive method called `display()` to print **O**s from top right to bottom left.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Example 1</th>
<th>Example 2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
How many lines to display? >> 5
 O
  O
   O
    O
     O
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
How many lines to display? >> 8
 O
  O
   O
    O
     O
      O
       O
        O
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
How many lines to display? >> 10
         O
        O
       O
      O
     O
    O
   O
  O
 O
O
```
