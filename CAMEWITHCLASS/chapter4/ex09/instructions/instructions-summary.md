The `LocalDate` class includes an instance method named `lengthOfMonth()` that returns the number of days in the month. Write an application called `DaysTilNextMonth` that allows the user to enter a month, day, and year and uses methods in the `LocalDate` class to calculate how many days are left until the first day of next month. For example, if the user enters **6** and **28** for the month and the day, the output should be: **There are 3 days until JULY starts**. 

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter the month as an integer >> 4 
Enter the day >> 19
Enter the year using four digits >> 1999
There are 12 days until MAY starts
```
