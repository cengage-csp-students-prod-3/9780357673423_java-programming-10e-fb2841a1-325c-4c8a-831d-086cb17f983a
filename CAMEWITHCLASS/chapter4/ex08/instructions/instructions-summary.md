Write an application called `TenThousandDaysOld` that prompts a user for the userâ€™s month, day, and year of birth and uses the `LocalDate` class to compute the day on which the user will become (or became) **10,000** days old. 

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter your birth month as an integer >> 04
Enter your birth day as an integer >> 23
Enter your birth year as a four-digit integer >> 1999
You are 10000 days old on 2026-09-08
```
