## Part A
Create a class named `Sandwich`. Data fields include a `String` for the main ingredient (such as tuna) as `mainIngredient`, a `String` for bread type (such as wheat) as `bread`, and a `double` for price (such as 4.99) as `price`. 

Include methods to get and set values for each of the three data fields.

## Part B
Create an application named `TestSandwich` that prompts the user for data, instantiates one `Sandwich` object, and displays its values.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter main sandwich ingredient >> tuna
Enter bread type >> wheat
Enter sandwich price >> 8.50
You have ordered a tuna sandwich on wheat bread, and the price is 8.5
```
