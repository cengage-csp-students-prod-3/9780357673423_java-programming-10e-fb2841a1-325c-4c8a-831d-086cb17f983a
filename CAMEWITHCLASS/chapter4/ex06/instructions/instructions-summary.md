Write a Java application called `MathTest` that uses the `Math` class to determine the answers for each of the following and print them to the console: 

- The square root of 37

- The sine and cosine of 300

- The value of the floor, ceiling, and round of 22.8


## Ungraded

- The larger and the smaller of the character D and the integer 71

- A random number between 0 and 20 

info> Hint: The `random()` method returns a value between **0** and **1**; you want a number that is 20 times larger.
