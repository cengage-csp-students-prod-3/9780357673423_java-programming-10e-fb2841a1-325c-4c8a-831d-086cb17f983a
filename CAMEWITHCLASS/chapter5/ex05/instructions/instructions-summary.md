## Part A
Write an application called `PastPresentFuture` that uses the `LocalDate` class to access the current date.


Prompt a user for a month, day, and year. Display a message that specifies whether the entered date is (1) not this year, (2) in an earlier month this year, (3) in a later month this year, or (4) this month.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter a month >> 7
Enter a day >> 20
Enter a year (four digits) >> 2021
7 is this month
```

## Part B
Copy the code from your `PastPresentFuture` program into `PastPresentFuture2`. Use the Web to learn how to use the `LocalDate` Boolean methods `isBefore()`, `isAfter()`, and `equals()`. Use your knowledge to write a program that prompts a user for a month, day, and year, and then displays a message specifying whether the entered day is in the past, the current date, or in the future.
