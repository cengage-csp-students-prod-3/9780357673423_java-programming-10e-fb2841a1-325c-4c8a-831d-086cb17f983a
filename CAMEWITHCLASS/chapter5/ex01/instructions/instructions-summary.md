Write an application called `EvenOdd` that asks a user to enter an integer. Pass the integer to a method called `isEven` that determines whether the number is even and returns a Boolean value. Display a statement that indicates whether the integer is even or odd.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a number >> 122
122 is even
```
