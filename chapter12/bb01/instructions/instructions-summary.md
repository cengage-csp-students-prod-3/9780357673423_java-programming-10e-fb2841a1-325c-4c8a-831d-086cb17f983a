## Scenario
You are fascinated with the recursive algorithm and how it can call itself to solve some computational problems. You want to combine the computational and visual display power to develop a pattern of **\***, based on a starting number the user inputs. 

In this exercise, the user will enter an integer value between 2 and 20 as the starting point for the visual display. The first line will display the number of stars entered by the user. The recursion algorithm will then display *n-1* **\*** in the next line and then *n-2* **\***, and so on for a visual display of **\*** until *n* becomes 0.

## Instructions
In this exercise, you will use a recursive algorithm to display a visual pattern of stars based on input from the user. User will input an integer value between 2-20 as a starting point for the visual pattern display. The algorithm will display the number of stars requested by the user on the first line.  The algorithm will start the next lines with *n-1*, *n-2*, *n-3*....stars per line until it reaches zero. Debug the syntax and logic errors.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a number between (2-20) for the first row display
